This summer, Ido is working on a team responsible for improving Google's ability to accurately categorize entities, people, and organizations in our search results.
         When asked how he became interested in this work, Ido spoke about the power of machine learning (ML). ‚ÄúSince the first courses I took about numerical algorithms and ML, I was amazed by the endless possibilities of these fields,‚Äù Ido explained. ‚ÄúUncovering hidden information from data can help us solve very difficult problems. Having the opportunity to do this at Google's scale is all the more exciting!‚Äù
         Thank you for all of your hard work this summer, Ido!
